# Credit System Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Real-time WebSocket Balance Updates

**What Changed:**
- Removed 30-second polling in favor of instant WebSocket updates
- Users now see balance changes in real-time when credits are spent or earned
- Both payer and recipient get instant notifications

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/websocket/bus.ts` - Added `emitToUser()` method to send messages to all connections of a specific user
- `backend/src/websocket/server.ts` (lines 1724-1744) - Emit balance updates after successful charges
- `frontend/src/components/nav-user.tsx` (lines 77-89) - Subscribe to WebSocket balance updates

**How It Works:**
1. After a successful credit transaction, backend fetches updated wallet balances
2. Backend sends WebSocket message with method `wallet.balance` to both users
3. Frontend listens for these messages and updates the balance display instantly

### 2. Actual Token Usage Tracking

**What Changed:**
- Replaced estimated token counts (text.length / 4) with actual LLM usage data
- More accurate billing based on real token consumption from OpenAI/Anthropic/etc
- Logging now shows "(actual)" vs "(estimated)" for transparency

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/agents/agent-orchestrator.ts`:
  - Line 76: Updated return type to include `tokenUsage?: { inputTokens: number; outputTokens: number }`
  - Lines 110-111: Added `totalInputTokens` and `totalOutputTokens` tracking variables
  - Lines 353-356: Capture token usage from LLM responses using `resp.usage.promptTokens` and `resp.usage.completionTokens`
  - Lines 133, 190, 224, 417, 471: Return token usage in all exit points

- `backend/src/websocket/server.ts`:
  - Line 1382: Declare `tokenUsage` variable to capture from orchestrator
  - Line 1523-1524: Extract token usage from orchestrator result
  - Lines 1668-1669: Use actual token counts if available, otherwise fall back to estimates
  - Line 1720: Log whether tokens are actual or estimated

**How It Works:**
1. Orchestrator accumulates token usage from each LLM call during agent execution
2. Returns total input/output tokens in the result object
3. WebSocket handler uses actual tokens for cost calculation
4. Falls back to estimation only if actual data is unavailable

### 3. Admin Control Panel

**What Changed:**
- New admin dashboard at `/admin` (only accessible to thomas@firstprinciple.co)
- Three tabs: Users, Agents, and Follows
- View all system data with wallet balances and relationships

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Main admin dashboard with tabs and tables
- `frontend/src/components/ui/table.tsx` - Reusable table components
- `frontend/src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts` - Proxy for users endpoint
- `frontend/src/app/api/admin/agents/route.ts` - Proxy for agents endpoint  
- `frontend/src/app/api/admin/follows/route.ts` - Proxy for follows endpoint

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/index.ts`:
  - Line 2634-2636: Added `isAdmin()` helper checking for your UUID
  - Lines 2507-2534: `GET /api/admin/users` - Lists all users with wallet balances
  - Lines 2536-2567: `GET /api/admin/agents` - Lists all agents with owner info
  - Lines 2569-2612: `GET /api/admin/follows` - Lists all follow relationships

- `backend/src/db/index.ts`:
  - Line 3: Added `wallets` to imports from schema
  - Line 46: Added `wallets` to exports

**Access:**
Navigate to `/admin` while signed in as thomas@firstprinciple.co to view:
- **Users Tab**: All registered users with their email, name, balance, and signup date
- **Agents Tab**: All agents with their name, owner info, public status
- **Follows Tab**: All active follow relationships between actors with metadata

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Means For Your App

1. **Instant Feedback**: Users see their balance update immediately when using agents
2. **Fair Billing**: Charges are based on actual LLM token usage, not estimates
3. **Full Visibility**: Admin panel gives you complete oversight of the system
4. **Better UX**: No more waiting 30 seconds for balance to refresh

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

1. **Real-time Updates**: 
   - Open app in two browser windows (different accounts)
   - Have one user chat with the other's agent
   - Watch both balances update instantly

2. **Token Tracking**:
   - Check backend logs after agent interactions
   - Look for lines showing "(actual)" vs "(estimated)"
   - Verify costs are lower/more accurate than before

3. **Admin Panel**:
   - Visit `/admin` as thomas@firstprinciple.co
   - Verify all three tabs load data correctly
   - Try accessing as another user (should see 403 Forbidden)

---

## ðŸ“Š Current Pricing Model

- **Base Cost**: Actual LLM token usage (input + output tokens Ã— model rate)
- **Markup**: 20% added to cover platform costs
- **Minimum**: 0.01 credits per message (prevents "free" micro-transactions)
- **Owner Exemption**: Users don't pay when using their own agents

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Not Critical)

Future enhancements to consider:
- Agent-to-agent payments (A2A credit transfers)
- Bulk credit operations (batch allocations)
- Credit purchase flow (Stripe integration)
- Enhanced admin tools (credit adjustments, user management)
- Transaction history export
- Credit analytics dashboard

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Database schema unchanged (only new exports added)
- WebSocket protocol extended (no breaking changes)
- Frontend gracefully handles missing WebSocket (falls back to polling)
- Admin endpoints protected by UUID check (not just email)
